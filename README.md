Dashboard Design

McDonald’s India sales data contained thousands of transactional records across multiple product categories, order times, and customer behaviors. However, the raw dataset was unstructured, with duplicates and missing values, making it difficult to extract meaningful insights for business decision-making.

 
The objective was to design an Excel-based interactive dashboard that could:
Summarize overall sales performance
Track order patterns across days and hours
Compare category-level performance
Highlight top-selling and low-performing items
Provide actionable insights for demand forecasting and product planning

Conducted data cleaning: removed duplicates, validated order values, and filled missing entries.
Structured raw transactional data for accurate reporting.
Built Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts to analyze sales by category, day of week, and hour of day.
Applied formulas and slicers to enable dynamic filtering and exploration.

Designed a dashboard summarizing key metrics:
$61.6K+ total sales
570 total orders
Average of 2 items per order
Performed time-based analysis to identify hourly demand spikes, daily fluctuations, and weekend vs weekday trends.
Compared top 5 menu items against low-performing products to highlight revenue drivers.

Result:

Delivered a clear, interactive dashboard that provided a snapshot of McDonald’s business performance.
Identified peak demand during evenings and weekends, guiding promotional strategies.
Revealed that burgers and beverages dominate revenue share, supporting inventory planning.
Highlighted McAloo Tikki and McSpicy Paneer as consistent top performers.
Enabled tracking of weekly sales distribution and seasonal spikes, improving forecasting accuracy.
Demonstrated how Excel can transform raw sales data into actionable business insights, supporting better product planning and operational decision-making.
